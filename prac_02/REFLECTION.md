What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?
So far, I have watched most of the videos intermittently.
But what helps me the most are my friends and teachers,
because they can solve my problems better.

What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?
Generally speaking, I'm not overly reliant on videos, so I won't spend all my time watching them.

What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
So far, I've been good at actively participating in class discussions. This not only helps me gain different perspectives 
but also deepens my understanding of the subject

What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
So far, in the process of my learning this course,
I've realized that I need to stop procrastinating 
on my assignments. I often put off starting tasks 
until the last minute, which results in hasty work 
and increased stress. To change this, I'll create a 
detailed schedule, allocating specific time slots for 
each assignment and setting myself early deadlines to 
ensure I have sufficient time for in - depth research and revisions.

What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this sub ject that you will change?
So far in the practicals of this subject, 
I've been struggling with time management. 
I often find myself spending too much time 
on one part of the experiment, leaving insufficient 
time to complete other crucial steps or analyze the 
results properly. To change this, I'll start by carefully
planning out each practical session in advance. 
I'll break down the tasks into smaller, more manageable 
chunks and allocate specific time limits to each one. 
This way, I can ensure that I move through the experiment
at a steady pace and don't get bogged down.

What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?
So far, I don't think I'll get distracted as easily as I used to during the learning process.
